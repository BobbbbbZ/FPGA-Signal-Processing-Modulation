# FPGA-Signal-Processing-Modulation-
In this project, I undertook the development of essential hardware components using SystemVerilog for the DE1-SoC FPGA board. These components included Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) and Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS), which served to create pseudo-random sequences and achieve key-shifting modulations. This work added depth and versatility to the FPGA's signal processing capabilities.

To ensure precise signal alignment, I employed advanced cross-domain techniques, which were meticulously validated through simulations. These simulations provided a robust foundation for ensuring that the signals could be accurately visualized on a VGA oscilloscope, making the system more reliable and effective. The integration of the Nios feature in Quartus Qsys played a vital role in this process, enhancing overall functionality.

One of the standout features of this project was the implementation of a music player. To achieve this, I utilized Matlab to encode music and its accompanying background picture into binary format. The result was a compelling user experience as the music and visuals were seamlessly presented on the Nios graphical user interface (GUI). This added a layer of interactivity and engagement to the system, making it more user-friendly and versatile.

In summary, this project represents a comprehensive exploration of FPGA-based signal processing, modulations, and graphical interface development. It demonstrates my ability to work with advanced FPGA components and integrate them effectively, providing a strong foundation for creating interactive and user-friendly systems.
